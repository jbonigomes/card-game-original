# Card Game

When game loads, wait for a second until all cards are flipped (visible).

You will have 3 seconds to memorise the order of the 4x3 grid (then they will unflip).

Click away to uncover the pairs (you can only flip 2 at a time).

When game finishes, you will be congratulated by a confetti explosion.

Game will then reset automatically after 3 seconds.

Enjoy!!
